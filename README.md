Minor work using Python to re-format "State Stringency" data to match with apm_report.csv

The "Tidy" version displays by-state, by-month (Jan 2020-Apr 2021), the "stringency" of each state's requirements.  This may or may not be useful.
The .ipynb also includes code to add "State" to the apm_report.
